## About Me

My Name is Toby Bui, currently i am a junior at Eden Prairie High School. I find joy in playing video games so i thought why not learn how to make some. so in 2018, I started to take APCSP( AP Computer Science Principles) to start learning the basics of coding and the differnt languages and to use differnt programs like MIT App Inventor. Since I liked creating the apps, i decided to take IOS app development in which we work with Swiftui and Xcode to create apps.

## Projects 
[Pinball Extravaganza](https://github.com/BuiToby/Pinball-Extravanganza): This was the end of the year project that i created, it was a pinball game that uses a lot of sprites, clocks, and a lot of math invloved with the "physics" of the ball. This is the aftermath of what I learned from APCSP using MIT App Inventor
