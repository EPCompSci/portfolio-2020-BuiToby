## About Me

My Name is Toby Bui, currently i am a junior at Eden Prairie High School. I find joy in playing video games so i thought why not learn how to make some. so in 2018, I started to take APCSP( AP Computer Science Principles) to start learning the basics of coding and the differnt languages and to use differnt programs like MIT App Inventor. Since I liked creating the apps, i decided to take IOS app development in which we work with Swiftui and Xcode to create apps.

## Projects 
[Pinball Extravaganza](https://github.com/BuiToby/Pinball-Extravanganza): This was the end of the year project that i created, it was a pinball game that uses a lot of sprites, clocks, and a lot of math invloved with the "physics" of the ball. This is the aftermath of what I learned from APCSP using MIT App Inventor

[Planetary Escape](https://github.com/BuiToby/Planetary-Escape) The was the first real and finished app that i created during APCSP, I created this with one of my classmates, and we created an addictive never ending game (unless you lose) with the main goal is to dodge oncoming obstacles and to see how long you can survive. This was my one of my apps when i started to learn how to create more complex codes in MIT App Inventor.

[ToDoToday](https://github.com/BuiToby/ToDoToday) This app was created to help the procrastinators with their struggling problem of procrasinating by creating a list that will tell you when and what you tasks you have to finish today. This was my first app the i created using Xcode and i created this because i wanted to learn the basics of Xcode and to also help with my problem of procrastinating. ðŸ™‚

[Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra](https://github.com/AnthonyKuismi/Super-Bird-Fighter-Ultra): This is the app that my group and I created that combines SwiftUI, SpriteKit, and animations. Our group has learned about creating animations and installing them into programming.


[Elmos Revenge](https://github.com/BuiToby/ElmosProject/blob/main/README.md): This was a learning experince for my group and I to follow along with a tutorial and create an app for toddlers.
